# This repository contains scripts that allow you to run a Flask Framework in an Aruba Networks environment operating on ArubaOS-Switch and ArubaOS-CX Network Operating Systems.
# To install the app, copy the complete folder to your home folder on the Ubuntu server and once copied, run the install.sh bash script as root user (you first have to make the script executable)
# chmod +x ./install.sh
# su ./install.sh
# If the script does not run, it could be that the format of the install.sh script is DOS format. You will need to convert the script to unix format. In that case, run the following commands:
#
# apt install dos2unix
# dos2unix ./install.sh
