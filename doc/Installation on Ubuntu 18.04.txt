Establish an SFTP connection from an SFTP client to the Ubuntu host using the user credentials that you have created during the installation of Ubuntu
Copy the Flask files (__init__.py, classes.py and static and templates folder) to the Ubuntu server from the SFTP client (they are stored in the /home/... folder
On the Ubuntu host, copy the files to the /var/www/html folder with the cp -r command

Check which adapter is your operational adapter:  ifconfig
Edit the listener.sh script in the /var/www/html/flask/bash folder and change the network adapter if necessary.

Prepare the listener:
chmod 777 ./listener.sh

Edit the __init__.py file and search for the line that contains the app.run command (at the bottom of the script).

Change the host IP entry to the IP address that is configured on the Ubuntu host and that is reachable from the network (or your local device).

Run the app with the following command:    python3 __init__.py
